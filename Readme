Software Requirements
Java - jdk-14.0.2
Maven
GitBash
local database with sql or gcp.

To run .jar in command line in the folder where it is type:
java -jar ims-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar

This will run the application on console allowing you to not have to run it in eclipse.


Which entity would you like to use?
CUSTOMER: Information about customers
ITEM: Individual Items
ORDER: Purchases of items
STOP: To close the application

Here are the options depending what table and object you want to make as a user.

Going into customer will allow for the creation of a customer into the database but also a instance of customer as a object in java.
the same goes for order and item and inside these you can do the same as customer.

What would you like to do with order:
CREATE: To save a new entity into the database
READ: To read an entity from the database
UPDATE: To change an entity already in the database
DELETE: To remove an entity from the database
RETURN: To return to domain selection

The only different out of all of them is that the update of order adds a item to a order and deletes a item from a order.
the customer can use this and follow the instructions in update to do this processs.

To do testing junits were used on each class throughout the project to activate this right click on the class you want to test
and run it as junit.

To download the project pull main branch with gitbash from the repoisitory.

To test coverage use sonar in the project folder with git bash and run mvn sonar:sonar.
